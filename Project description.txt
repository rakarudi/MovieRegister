On startup of the project you get directed to the Home of the application.
Here we can se what movies we recently watched so we easly can find them and continue watching.
We can also navigate to Home by using the navigation bar at the top of the page.

In the navigation bar we also have Movie and Favorits.
If we press favorits we se a list with all movies that is our favorits.

If we press Movie we can see all the movies in the database(XML-file)
On this page we also get the opportunity to search for movies, here we can search for part of title, description and also genre.

On all movies we have three buttons to press. A star, a bin and also a edit button.

The star can favoritise a movie or un-favoritise.
The bin can remove a movie completly from the Movie Register. (WARNING! Developer have been sloppy and not added a "Do you really want to delete this movie?")
The edit can edit a movie and takes us to the editmovie page.

On the Movie page we also have a button called "Add a movie"
With this button we can add a new movie to the Movie Register.

Pressing the button takes us to the Addmovie page where we have to enter all the data of the movie.
If a movietitle is a correct one the poster of the movie will automaticly be added for us.

On all pages we can press a movie to show more detaild information about the movie.
Here we can see the description and also all other data of the movie.

We can also "Watch the movie" by pressing "Play Movie" and now you would be very impressed if you really could watch the movie.
The only thing "Play Movie" button dose is making the movie recently watched and now it will be displayed on the Home with the other recently watched movies.


I belive this is all the Movie register can do and i hope you are pleased with the Register!
